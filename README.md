# Stack-with-Symbol-Balancing

This program creates stack using ArrayList and performs balancing of symbols as explained below:

Given an expression like this, [({}{})], this algorithm checks for balanced symbols,

Pushes each opening symbol onto the stack created using the ArrayList.
For each closing symbol, it pops the stack, and if the symbol popped is not the matching the opening symbol, an error is thrown.
When done, the stack is emptied.
